Simple PHP MVC Boilerplate / Scaffolding 


Think rails but dummer (and simpler). Does it make sense to make a Ruby gem for a php framework? No. Does it matter? No.



Using Simon to setup the boilerplate
```php
gem install my-simon
```

Create a new simon project in current folder
```php
simon create
```

Using Simon to add a new section
```php
simon add section
```

Using Simon to add [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) PHP compatability
```php
simon add heroku
```

Using Simon to add a javascript file to be downloaded locally and to add it to the footer
```php
simon add js [url to js file]
```

Using Simon to add basic Backbone
```php
simon add backbone
```
